Fleetspeak (for Rust)
=====================

[Fleetspeak][fleetspeak] is a communication framework with a focus on security
monitoring. Currently, it is primarily used in the [GRR][grr] project (an remote
live forensics framework).

This repository contains a library for writing code in the [Rust][rust] language
for server- and client-side Fleetspeak services.

This project is not an official Google product, is under heavy development and
should not be used for any production code. It is merely a proof of concept and
part of the experiment of rewriting the GRR client in Rust.
