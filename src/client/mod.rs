//! An Fleetspeak client connector library.
//!
//! This library exposes a set of functions for writing client-side Fleetspeak
//! services. Each of these functions operates on a global connection object
//! that is lazily established. If this global connection cannot be established,
//! the library will panic (because without this connection Fleetspeak will shut
//! down the service anyway).
//!
//! Note that each service should send startup information upon its inception
//! and continue to heartbeat from time to time to notify the Fleetspeak client
//! that it did not get stuck.
